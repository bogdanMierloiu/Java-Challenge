# JAVA CHALLENGE
This project represents one of the early milestones in my programming journey, and it holds sentimental value as a reminder of my beginnings in software development.

Overview
The Java Challenge introduces a gamification platform tailored for software developers, designed to foster engagement, knowledge sharing, and skill development within the developer community. Through innovative features and incentivized interactions, developers can enhance their proficiency, earn rewards, and expand their network.

Functionality
Quizzes: Users can post quizzes in the form of questions and allocate rewards in $JAVA tokens for their solutions.
Answer Submission: Developers can submit answers to existing quizzes, striving to provide accurate and insightful solutions.
Validation: Question authors validate answers, triggering the transfer of reward tokens from their wallets to the wallets of the users who provided correct answers.
NFT Rewards: Users achieve milestones by accumulating validated answers, earning coveted NFTs such as "Adventurer" and "Cosmonaut" as recognition for their contributions.
Reputation System: Users' reputations evolve based on their participation and performance, further enriching the gamified experience.
Token Transfers: Developers can exchange $JAVA tokens among themselves, fostering a vibrant economy within the platform.
Admin Privileges: Administrators wield comprehensive control over all platform functionalities, ensuring smooth operation and user management.
Technical Details
Technology Stack: The platform is developed using Java programming language and the Spring Boot MVC framework.
Database: MySQL relational database facilitates efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring seamless interaction with the application.
Communication: The interaction between the application and the database is facilitated through the Spring Data JPA interface.
Entities: Key entities such as Player, Wallet, Wallet History, Reputation, NFT, Question, and Answer define the core functionalities of the platform, enabling robust gamification mechanics.
Purpose
The Java Challenge serves as a catalyst for learning, collaboration, and growth within the developer community. By gamifying the learning process and incentivizing engagement, the platform empowers developers to sharpen their skills, expand their knowledge, and forge meaningful connections with their peers. Through continuous iteration and enhancement, the platform aims to revolutionize developer education and foster a culture of innovation and excellence. It's worth noting that the platform does not utilize blockchain technology; instead, tokens are generated from the database, and NFTs consist of images stored within the application.
